# Smart Investment Advice - Part 1
This repository contains the initial part of the Smart Investment Advice project, which focuses on predicting future trends in the USD exchange rate and gold prices using time series analysis and machine learning models. The goal of this project is to provide insights into investment strategies based on historical financial data.

Data
The data used in this project includes:

- Historical USD exchange rates.
- Historical EUR exchange rates.
- Historical GBP exchange rates.
- Historical gold prices.
  
Both datasets cover the period from 2005 to 2024 and contain daily closing prices. These datasets are publicly available and have been preprocessed for the purpose of this project.

# Smart Investment Advice - Part 2
We selected the appropriate ML algorithm from the dataset that we set up and saved earlier in this part and got the best result. We preferred LSTM as an algorithm and drew the images tested with the algorithm.
